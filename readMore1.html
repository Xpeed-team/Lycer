      <h2>IWQI Background</h2>
      <p>by <span class="text-primary">Sajjad Al-Ali</span> Sep 7, 2023</p>
      <p>he explanation of the water quality parameters for non-specialists and the common public is not easily
        understandable. Hence, IWQI proved to be an easy way to
        brovide information on water quality for citizens and policy makers. IWQI use data on water quality and assists
        in modifying the environmental policies designed by
        vironmental agencies, indexes can compare sites and track changes at one site over time.
        orton index 1965 was the first index followed by NSFWQI where both of them were designed using Delphi method to
        combine the opinions of a large panel of water]
        bxperts from throughout the US, panel members were polled by mail using questionnaires. Our index also depends
        on the Delphi method and the questionnaire was
        kent to panel members using a google form, where the selection of parameters included in our model was subjected
        to local and international opinions of experts in
        he aquatic environment to determine the importance of each parameter in IWQI and for each water uses. The
        primary aim of water quality indices is to give a single
        alue for water quality by converting the data on the component and their concentrations in a sample into a
        unique number, So, comparing different samples for their
        huality will be easy based on each sample's index value.</p>

      <h2>Problem Statement?</h2>
      <p>Assessing water quality with a large amount of data is difficult, and the inability to interpret these data for
        non-specialists and to a public audience, so we chose to use water quality indices to solve this problem to
        inform the real status of the aquatic system In order to save the water source, especially nowadays where all
        freshwater is threatened by low quality and quantity that's related to climate change.</p>

      <h2>IWQI properties</h2>
      <ol>
        <li class="ms-3">
          <p> IWQIs work by condensing selected variables into a single unitless score, allowing one to notice the
            changes in water over time or comparisons between different water bodies.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="ms-3">
          <p> A total of 70% of the data was used for building this Water Quality Index (IWQI) model and 30% was used
            for testing the model, multiple scenarios were revealed the effect of the increasing numbers of parameters
            on the index value.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="ms-3">
          <p> This IWQI gave the possibility to the user to eliminate any parameter from the index on one condition the
            summation of the final weight never falls below 0.7.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="ms-3">
          <p> The IWQI application is easy to use and available to enter the data at any time and anywhere to reveal the
            water condition.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="ms-3">
          <p> This IWQI can be used by many local and international environmental agencies around the world.
